(Jerry Holt/The Minnesota Star Tribune) Minneapolis is struggling to eliminate backlogs of police misconduct complaints and officer use-of-force reviews, largely due to a staffing deficit, though the city has made strides in other reform goals since March 2024, according to an evaluator\u2019s report released Monday. The report, by Washington, D.C.-based independent monitor group Effective Law Enforcement For All, is the first to measure the city\u2019s progress in complying with the terms of a settlement struck with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. As of last September, the Police Department still had more than 1,100 force cases in queue for review by command staff, a mandatory process when an officer restrains a person, uses a Taser or baton, fires a gun or uses any other measure of force. \u201cOf greater concern,\u201d the report says, is that 15 of those were classified as \u201ccritical incidents,\u201d such as an officer-involved shooting. The report also cites lags in misconduct complaints handled by the Police Department\u2019s internal affairs unit and the city\u2019s Office of Police Conduct Review. As of Jan. 30, internal affairs counted 44 cases as backlog, according to data presented to a city committee recently. The Office of Police Conduct Review had 83 complaints in queue that were over a month old, a separate report shows. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara said Monday morning the department has trained more members of the command staff to help conduct the internal affairs investigations and opened up overtime hours to expedite the process. The city has also contracted with a law firm to help with the force reviews, he said. \u201cI can\u2019t say with certainty that the backlog will be cleared by the deadline,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cBut I feel very, very confident that if not cleared, we will have made substantial progress. It still remains to be seen.\u201d Similarly, said Civil Rights Director Michelle Phillips, the Office of Police Conduct Review is also still facing a backlog in part due to staffing issues. \u201cThe bottom line: There is still backlog,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cButb wiaes :arLee amna LkeifntgB piaros gsrpelist sa.\u201dcross 3 sources 33% 67% Other sources +-1 https://www.startribune.com/mpd-touts-progress-in-police-reforms-but-lags-in-closing-out-complaints-and-force-reviews/601216318 1/4 2/4/25, 10:45 AM Minneapolis touts progress in police reforms, but lags in closing out complaints and force reviews The deadline to eliminate or make \u201csubstantial progress\u201d to clearing the backlogs is March 17, the one-year anniversary of the monitor\u2019s contract going into effect. David Douglass, one of the court-appointed monitors, called the deadline \u201cartificial,\u201d noting it\u2019s part of a working agreement with the city and not mandated in the settlement. \u201cA lot of progress is being made,\u201d Douglass said in an interview Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked closely with them all along the way and we\u2019re comfortable with that.\u201d As a whole, several city leaders touted the report as evidence of the progress the city has made since entering into the court-enforceable agreement with the state, on track to comply with several of the one-year goals. Much of that work comes in the form of writing or revising confusing and ineffectual policies, addressing technical or equipment issues and revising training. O\u2019Hara said the department has overhauled the field-training program, as an example. \u201cThis is the beginning of a long journey that will take time,\u201d said Community Safety Commissioner Todd Barnette, \u201cbut the city is fully on board and working diligently toward sustainable reform beyond compliance with the settlement agreement.\u201d The Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreement is expected to last at least four years.

By Deena Winter The Minnesota Star Tribune JANUARY 30, 2025 AT 11:14AM Patty Day said Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin cracked her tooth, bruised her body and injured her arm during an arrest in January 2020. (Jerry Holt) Patty Day was sitting in her Volkswagen minivan on a snowy south Minneapolis street on Jan. 17, 2020, when a police officer came up to the car and soon yanked her out, threw her face-down on the street and ground his knee into her back. About four months later, that officer, Derek Chauvin, made headlines and sparked protests across the globe for taking a similar approach to a man named George Floyd. Except that time, Floyd died under Chauvin\u2019s knee on a south Minneapolis street as the world later watched in horror. Day was struggling with a divorce and had been drinking too much before getting in her van, but she said Chauvin immediately escalated the situation, cracking her tooth, bruising her body and injuring her arm and shoulder before handcuffing her and pressing his knee into her back as he cuffed her and she cried out in pain. \u201cThe look in his eye was so evil. I feared for my life. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to survive this. It all escalated so quickly,\u201d she told the Minnesota Star Tribune last year, when she filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Chauvin, the city and Chauvin\u2019s former partner, Ellen Jensen, alleging Chauvin was a \u201clong-troubled officer with a documented pattern of misconduct, to which MPD and city leaders willfully turned a blind eye.\u201d The lawsuit alleged the city had a longstanding practice of \u201cunchecked Fourth Amendment violations\u201d by police and sought at least $9 million in damages, but it will be settled for $600,000 after it was approved by the Minneapolis City Council after a closed-door session Thursday. The vote was 10-0, with Council Members Jamal Osman absent and Linea Palmisano recused because Day used to be her policy aide. According to the settlement, $175,000 will go to Day and $425,000 to her attorneys. The lawsuit was bought by the Robins Kaplan law firm, where lawyer Bob Bennett has made a career of winning large settlements with the city over police brutality cases. In 2023, Bennett won settlements of $7.5 million and $1.4 million due to Chauvin\u2019s violent treatment of John Pope Jr. and Zoya Code. https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-lawsuit-settlement-patty-day-derek-chauvin/601214286 1/6 2/4/25, 10:44 AM Minneapolis settles suit with woman Derek Chauvin violently arrested \u201cThis kneeing maneuver was Defendant Chauvin\u2019s calling card,\u201d the lawsuit alleged. \u201cChauvin was a serial predator who was never stopped by the city.\u201d bias: Lean Left Bias split across 31 sources 36% 38% 26% Other sources +38 \u2018I wasn\u2019t being combative' On the day she encountered Chauvin, Day was working in communications for the Minneapolis Public Works department. Struggling with an impending divorce, she spent that day drinking at home before leaving to pick up her child from daycare. After driving a couple of blocks, she realized she shouldn\u2019t be driving, pulled over, turned off her van, threw the keys in the back and fell asleep crying, the lawsuit said. She used her remote starter to turn on the car and stay warm but wasn\u2019t planning to drive any farther. Someone called 911 and reported an intoxicated person sitting in a vehicle stuck in a snowbank for several hours. About an hour later, at about 9 p.m., Chauvin and Jensen showed up. Jensen talked to Day for a bit before Chauvin reached into the van and grabbed Day\u2019s left arm while Jensen grabbed the right. \u201cThey threw me fast down into the street in the snow very forcefully,\u201d Day told the Star Tribune. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask me to get out of the car. I wasn\u2019t being combative. I wasn\u2019t being difficult. I just wanted them to know I wasn\u2019t trying to drive.\u201d She said Chauvin threw her in the squad car sideways with her bleeding hands cuffed tightly behind her back. A third officer arrived and arrested her for driving while intoxicated. In their police reports, Jensen and Chauvin said they merely ordered Day out of the van. As with other Chauvin incidents \u2014 such as Pope\u2019s \u2014 no use-of-force incident report was filed, as required by Minneapolis Police Department policy. The lawsuit said the \u201ccity\u2019s recalcitrance is unsurprising, as the city attorney\u2019s office routinely uses faux confidentiality concerns under the Minnesota Government Data to withhold [body-worn camera] video from persons depicted thereon \u2014 despite clear law mandating its release.\u201d Tests put Day\u2019s blood alcohol level at 0.25%, roughly triple the legal threshold for driving, and she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of DUI. But Hennepin County District Judge Julie Allyn ordered the test results suppressed, saying the officers didn\u2019t have probable cause to arrest Day, and the city dropped the charges in 2021. The lawsuit noted the city has paid nearly $80 million in the last two decades due to unconstitutional use of force by MPD officers and that the city\u2019s 12 costliest settlements from 2006 to 2012 resulted in no officer discipline. \u201cIf the city refuses to pay for a good police force, it will pay dearly for a bad one,\u201d the suit said. Robins Kaplan partner Katie Bennett said Chauvin really seemed to prey on vulnerable people at their lowest, unnecessarily using physical force, and Day wanted to hold the city accountable for \u201cbasically creating Chauvin.\u201d \u201cI think that\u2019s powerful for plaintiffs to be able to do and stand up to Chauvin, the city\u2019s monster.\u201d Minneapolis touts progress in police reforms, but lags in closing out complaints and force reviews Inmate escaped as he awaited transfer from Hennepin County jail"}

She will face the jury along with Salim Said, who owned Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis. By Jeffrey Meitrodt The Minnesota Star Tribune FEBRUARY 3, 2025 AT 9:31AM Aimee Bock, executive director of nonprofit Feeding Our Future, speaks to the Star Tribune on Jan. 27, 2022, just days after the FBI searched her St. Anthony offices. (Shari L. Gross/The Minnesota Star Tribune) Three years after FBI agents raided Aimee Bock\u2019s home and business to kickstart one of the largest fraud investigations in Minnesota history, the alleged ringleader of an extraordinary pay-to-play scheme featuring dozens of co-conspirators will finally get her day in court Monday. During Bock\u2019s much-anticipated trial, prosecutors will portray the controversial founder of a St. Anthony nonprofit known as Feeding Our Future as the mastermind who figured out how dozens of people could steal $250 million from a federal program meant to feed children in need, court records show. Bock has denied the allegations, saying she received no improper payments and was unaware of any fraud taking place. Her trial will be only the second in the sprawling case. Security measures will be bolstered after last year\u2019s trial ended with an attempted bribe of a juror, a rare incident that drew international media attention and resulted in jurors being sequestered for their safety. Of the 70 people charged since 2022 in the massive case, 30 have pleaded guilty; five tied to a Shakopee restaurant were convicted by a jury last year, and two were acquitted. At least 13 of the defendants who pleaded guilty have been identified as potential witnesses for the prosecution in the coming trial, court records show. The trial is scheduled to last more than a month. Also going on trial this week is Salim Said, co-owner of Safari Restaurant, a once-small Minneapolis business that federal investigators have identified as one of the largest beneficiaries of the fraud scheme. Prosecutors have described the scheme as a brazen effort to get rich fast by falsely claiming to feed thousands of children every day at sites controlled by Feeding Our Future and its partners, including Safari Restaurant. https://www.startribune.com/alleged-ringleader-in-250-million-meals-fraud-case-goes-on-trial-this-week/601215790 1/7 2/4/25, 10:44 AM Aimee Bock, Feeding Our Future leader, takes case to jury trial bias: Lean Left Bias split across 4 sources 25% 75% Other sources +2 Feeding Our Future allegedly organized the fraud by recruiting participants willing to pay kickbacks for the chance to file reimbursement claims for millions of meals that were never provided. In 2021 alone, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future received nearly $18 million in federal funds for its 10% cut of the action, allegedly camouflaged as \u201cadministrative fees.\u201d What to expect at the trial The trial will start with jury selection. The process lasted four days in last year\u2019s trial as attorneys struggled to find jurors who didn\u2019t have strong opinions about the high-profile case. Prosecutors have said they will show the jury hundreds of documents, including emails, text messages between defendants, FBI surveillance video, invoices and checks tracing money to new luxury car and home purchases. Witnesses are expected to include FBI forensic accountants and case agents. The offices of Feeding Our Future are shown Jan. 27, 2022, a week after an FBI raid. (Shari L. Gross/The Associated Press) In a surprise twist, two defendants slated to join Bock and Said on trial pleaded guilty last week. Eight others charged with Bock in the same indictment are expected to stand trial in April and June. One defendant pleaded guilty in 2023, and another, Abdikerm Eidleh, a former Feeding Our Future employee, fled the country. Unlike many of her co-defendants who were accused of improperly diverting millions of dollars of federal funding for their own use, Bock has not been accused of buying expensive property or hiding money abroad. Prosecutors say she personally obtained $1.2 million in fraudulent proceeds, mostly by giving money to a construction firm owned by her then-boyfriend, court records show. As the head of Feeding Our Future, Bock paid herself $190,000 a year. After the FBI searched her business and home, she was forced to turn over $185,000 from her bank account and the keys to her 2013 Porsche Panamera. Authorities also seized $13,462 in cash from her. Prosecutors said bank records show Bock and her boyfriend used proceeds from the fraud to fund their personal lifestyle, including spending more than $50,000 on travel and \u201ctens of thousands of dollars\u201d on luxury purchases and jewelry. Since she was charged in September 2022, Bock has lost her Rosemount house and now lives with her parents, said her attorney, Kenneth Udoibok. He said Bock has been unable to find work since losing her job with a ridesharing company. https://www.startribune.com/alleged-ringleader-in-250-million-meals-fraud-case-goes-on-trial-this-week/601215790 2/7 2/4/25, 10:44 AM Aimee Bock, Feeding Our Future leader, takes case to jury trial bias: Lean Left Bias split across 4 sources 25% 75% Other sources +2 \u201cIf she did this, where\u2019s the money?\u201d Udoibok asked in an interview with the Minnesota Star Tribune last week. In a court filing, he said Bock \u201cdid not make any extravagant purchases,\u201d and he denied she took a July 2021 trip to Las Vegas that the government says cost more than $20,000. Moreover, Bock said in the 2022 interview that her boyfriend\u2019s company was paid more than $800,000 for doing legitimate renovation work at her nonprofit\u2019s offices. Udoibok said Bock wants to testify at the trial, but he has not decided whether that would be the right move. \u201cTo make her the fall girl is unfair,\u201d Udoibok said. \u201cI am hoping the jury will see this. Aimee is an innocent woman.\u201d Aimee Bock, executive director of nonprofit Feeding Our Future, speaks publicly for the first time days after the FBI searched her St. Anthony offices in January 2022. (Shari L. Gross/The Minnesota Star Tribune) According to court records, Said allegedly diverted as much as $10 million for his personal use by claiming his Lake Street restaurant provided more than 10,000 meals daily. Prosecutors say Said used some of the money to buy a $1.2 million home with an indoor basketball court in Plymouth, a $60,000 Mercedes and a $47,000 pickup truck. Said and other business partners also allegedly spent more than $5 million to buy commercial properties in Uptown Minneapolis and Columbus, Ohio, court records show. Said\u2019s attorneys did not return a request for comment. \u2018Vindictive\u2019 prosecution The case centers around meal programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for low-income children after school and during the summer. Meal distribution sites are overseen by \u201csponsors,\u201d like Feeding Our Future. Bock\u2019s nonprofit oversaw more than 200 food distribution sites across Minnesota and quickly grew \u2014 from receiving about $3 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. In court filings, Udoibok argued that the government\u2019s case is \u201cpotentially selective or vindictive\u201d because Bock sued the Minnesota Department of Education, which administers the federal funding, in 2020 when the state agency tried to block the rapid growth of her operation. But prosecutors say Bock played a key role in the scheme. As head of Feeding Our Future, she was responsible for ensuring her providers were actually serving the huge number of meals they claimed to be. Instead, prosecutors said in a trial brief, Bock \u201cgave false assurances\u201d when state officials questioned the sky-high meal counts. In her 2022 interview with the Star Tribune, Bock maintained that she and other Feeding Our Future employees visited meal sites \u2014 many of which were overseen by individual nonprofits \u2014 as often as once a month to make sure they were following federal guidelines. \u201cWe have verified the nonprofits pass out the food,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWe have verified the nonprofits purchase the food.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a criminal mind,\u201d she added. \u201cCould I be outsmarted by somebody who is good at it?

Udoibok sought in court filings to prevent Ahmed from testifying in this month\u2019s trial.

Police chiefs are now willing to fire problem officers, he said, and county attorneys are unafraid to charge them. Several officers accused of serious misconduct, including the four involved in Floyd\u2019s death, have been criminally convicted. The all-male class is joining the department at a time of rapid change amid two court-mandated reform efforts seeking to rebuild public trust and replenish the depleted police ranks. Many fresh recruits said they\u2019re not intimidated by the challenge. \u201cI felt like I had a golden ticket I couldn\u2019t say no to,\u201d said officer Mohamed Qasim, a 23-year-old Southwest High School graduate who jumped at the opportunity to patrol the city where he spent his childhood. The idea of doing noble work, while representing the growing Somali-American population, made him beam with pride. Mayor Jacob Frey and Chief Brian O\u2019Hara hailed a \u201cturning point\u201d in their recruitment efforts following years of rapid decline. For the first time since 2018, the department ended the calendar year with a net increase of officers, adding 36 sworn staff after a targeted marketing push and a historic pay increase. \u201cWe\u2019re on a much stronger trajectory,\u201d said O\u2019Hara, noting that 85 more people are in line to become cadets, community service officers or interns. Applications jumped by 133% by the end of 2024, partly driven by an influx of lateral hires, legacy recruits and a monthslong \u201cImagine Yourself\u201d campaign that flooded social media with ads aimed at rebranding modern policing. When O\u2019Hara was hired in 2022, the staffing shortage had become so dire advisers cautioned he may need to close a precinct. Veteran officers, plagued by low morale, strongly discouraged friends and family from joining the department. \u201cIt was a really dark place,\u201d O\u2019Hara said, recalling the elevated levels of violent crime and sense of numbness in the community. \u201cThe odds were very, very stacked against us.\u201d https://www.startribune.com/in-first-minneapolis-police-graduation-of-2025-officials-hail-turning-point-in-departments-history/601215006 2/5 2/4/25, 10:44 AM In first Minneapolis police graduation of 2025, officials hail \u2018turning point\u2019 in department\u2019s history The rank-and-file hit an all-time low of 560 last March, down from more than 900 in early 2020, according to payroll data.

It\u2019s a promising turnaround nearly five years after Floyd\u2019s killing \u2014 and amid a recent consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice over its findings the department engaged in a pattern of racist policing practices. That latest reform effort, the most sweeping to date, has yet to be signed by a federal judge. Its future remains in jeopardy, given that the Trump administration froze all federal civil rights litigation last week.

(Ren\u00e9e Jones Schneider/The Minnesota Star Tribune) Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey says he\u2019s running for a third term, which would be his last four years at the helm of a city he led through a pandemic and police brutality case that rocked the world. Frey served on the City Council from 2013 until he was elected mayor in 2017, and was in the job for two years before the COVID-19 pandemic struck and Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m running because I love this city, and we got to get the job done, and our city has come through the adversity of big city challenges over the last several years, and we\u2019re coming back with real results,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI want to see this job through. I want to see the work through to set the next mayor up for success, and the city up for success.\u201d He said if re-elected, he would not run for a fourth term. \u201cThis will be my final term,\u201d he said. Frey has become a controversial figure in the Democratic stronghold of Minneapolis. Those on the far left, including those in control of the City Council, regularly clash with him over issues such as homeless encampments, a call for a ceasefire to the Israel-Hamas war and how much Uber and Lyft drivers\u2019 pay should increase. \u201cRight now, we need people with the courage to tell their own side what they don\u2019t want to hear,\u201d Frey said. \u201cSay what you want about me: I\u2019ve had the guts to stand up and do what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s tough.

Last year was the first time in five years that the Minneapolis Police Department ended the year with a net increase of officers, adding 36 officers after a recruitment campaign and significant pay increase. He also points to another change, creation of a new Office of Community Safety. The city now diverts about 9% of its calls for service to alternate responders, such as a behavioral crisis response team. People often come into office thinking they\u2019re going to change it, but instead more often the office changes them, Frey said. \u201cWhat you get over time is you get thicker skin, and you get the courage to do the right thing, even when it\u2019ll subject you to a pummeling at times from both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have right now is people that flip their positions all over, depending on when the political winds are blowing.\u201d He is being challenged in the election by the Rev.

(Angelina Katsanis/The Minnesota Star Tribune) The University of Minnesota law school is pausing the search for its next assistant dean of diversity, equity, and inclusion as administrators navigate President Donald Trump\u2019s ban of DEI programs in the federal government. The university also is tightening up its messaging about diversity work, by implementing a new systemwide policy requiring legal counsel to review all internal and external communications related to DEI. Spokesman Jake Ricker said the university is not rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion or making preemptive changes to existing programs. But he said the university is moving forward cautiously, including by freezing the new hire, while administrators seek clarity on the White House directives. President Trump has aggressively moved to abolish diversity and inclusion offices and programs across the U.S. government by leveraging federal money. Higher education relies on federal dollars for many programs, research projects and contract work. Trump has called for investigations into whether some schools with endowments over $1 billion are complying with his orders. Universities are scrambling in response to the edicts, with some colleges renaming programs, assessing titles, suspending research projects and canceling events related to diversity. Others are remaining quiet or vowing to continue DEI initiatives. At the University of Minnesota, law school Dean William McGeveran said in a Friday email, provided to the Star Tribune, that as the university reassesses its programs related to diversity, it became \u201cclear that we have no choice\u201d but to halt the search for a new assistant dean of diversity, equity and inclusion.
